Not your monkeys, unless you are Stefania.

### Prerequisities

The script in this repository depends on the `belle2` style for `matplotlib`.

The instructions for the style installation can be found [here](https://stash.desy.de/projects/B2/repos/plot_style/browse/matplotlib/README.md).

If you do not have access to the link, I am sorry, but you are doomed.
